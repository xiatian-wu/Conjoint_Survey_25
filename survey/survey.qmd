# Welcome to our survey!

Hi! We are a research team of George Washington University. This survey
will ask you simple questions regarding your purchase preference for
used cars.

This survey will take about **10 minutes** to complete. It can be
stopped and picked up at any time. Your personal information will be
kept private and won't be shared with anyone else. The survey is
subdivided in five sub-sections:

-   Current vehicle information

-   Future vehicle information

-   Choice Questions

-   Knowledge of electric vehicles

-   Demographic Information


**We greatly appreciate your participation!**

# Consent

## Informed Consent for Participation in a Research Study

You are invited to participate in a research study directed by Dr. John
Paul Helveston of the Department of Engineering Management and Systems
Engineering at George Washington University (GWU) and funded by the
Department of Energy. Participation is entirely voluntary and you may
obtain further information regarding this study by contacting us at
gwuvehiclegroup7\@gmail.com .

The purpose of this study is to identify the preferences and needs of
car ownership in different communities. If you choose to participate in
this study, you will be asked to answer an online survey about vehicle
ownership and preference. The total amount of time you will spend on
this study is 10 minutes. You may refuse to answer any of the questions
and stop participating at any time.

**Benefits** : The most important reason why someone would like to
participate in this study is that they can share their vehicle usage
needs and help inform policies that decide incentives on EV ownership.
You will not benefit directly from your participation in the study.
However, the benefits to science and humankind that might result from
this study include implementing electric vehicle subsidy policies that
are more in tune with people's requirements.

**Concerns/Risks** : You may not choose to volunteer for this study if
you do not want to share information about your vehicle usage. Possible
risks or discomforts you could experience during this study include: -
Although very unlikely, there is a risk of email address information
being compromised if it is shared and in case our systems are
compromised. - Psychological stress could be caused by the time and
effort spent answering the survey.

**Confidentiality** : Every effort will be made to keep your information
confidential. However, this cannot be guaranteed. The data will be
stored in a secured online database which only the PI and student
researcher can access. If the results of this research study are
reported in journals or at scientific meetings, the people who
participated in this study will not be named or identified.

**Additional Information** : The Office of Human Research of George
Washington University, at telephone number (202) 994-2715, can provide
further information about your rights as a research participant.Your
willingness to participate in this research study is implied if you
proceed.

**Participation to this survey is voluntary. To take a part in this
survey, you must:** 

-   Be at least 18 years old.
-   Authorize us to analyze the data exclusively for research purposes.

By clicking on "**I Agree**", you confirm that you have reviewed and
understood the information provided in the welcome page and this consent
page, and agree to participate in the "Car Ownership Survey".

Great Work! Now that you have shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a scenario in which you can choose a car from a set of cars with different attributes.

Let's learn about the attributes.
